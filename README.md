The EOSBIXIN group is affiliated to Bixin, led by Bixin COO Chaojijun, and is a newly formed group of outstanding engineers from departments such as mining pools, nodes, and wallets. We have recognized that the blockchain is moving from the underlying technology era to the product era. As a high-performance blockchain, EOS will carry free distribution and circulation of human values in all aspects, therefore, we built the two basic foundations of EOSBIXIN SuperNode and Bixin EOS Wallet to provide a robust network for EOS, and at the same time make it easier for everyone to use EOS to achieve the prosperity and development of EOS ecology.
